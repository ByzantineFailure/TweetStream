#Twitter Watcher

Just a little thing I'm doing to play around with React in a more real way

Watches a twitter tag and updates whenever something is tweeted.  

Does 3-legged auth with Twitter.

Requires you to have the following twitter API environment variables set up:
* `TWITTER_CONSUMER_KEY`
* `TWITTER_CONSUMER_SECRET`

Also requires you to have paths to your cert and key into the following variables:
* `TWITTER_STREAM_PKEY`
* `TWITTER_STREAM_CERT`
